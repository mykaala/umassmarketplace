For milestone 3, I have created the Sign in/Up page(Except for the navigation bar which was created by teammate(s) and I just added it to my page), which by default is a sign in page but there is a toggle which allows the users to navigate between sign in and sign up forms. It has numerous different textboxes which get the user input and provide feedback in case it is not correct. I have also updated the diagram-ui.md file.

For Milestone 4, I did create backend endpoints and router for the sign up and sign in page enabling local authentication. I also updated the front end code of sign in sign up page to include the functional navbar and send requests to backend when all the required fields are satisfied.
