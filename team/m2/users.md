# Target Users

## Primary Users

The intended users of this application are the UMass Amherst students in the first place. 
However, It has a great potential to be expanded to other colleges across the country and even the world and perhaps become available to the general public. 

## User Needs

Amherst is located really far from every major city and many of the students who attend it have to relocate and no matter if they want to live on or off campus, they will need to get some goods necessary for living on their own as well as attending the classes. As college students, buying new goods is not always the first choice for majority of the people. Meanwhile, there are some people, including UMass graduates. who are leaving Amherst due to various reasons and they are willing to sell many of their used goods for a lower price than new, instead of carrying them all the way or simply throwing them away. Our application aims to connect these two groups of people to each other in order to effectively help UMass and Amherst community in satisfying some needs that might be specific to them.
