# Target Users

## Primary Users

The intended users of this application are the UMass Amherst students in the first place. 
However, It has a great potential to be expanded to other colleges across the country and even the world and perhaps become available to the general public. 

## User Needs

Amherst is located really far from every major city and many of the students who attend it have to relocate and no matter if they want to live on or off campus, they will need to get some goods necessary for living on their own as well as attending the classes. As college students, buying new goods is not always the first choice for the majority of the people. Also for other residents, it might be preferred to obtain the goods without going to another town far from Amherst. 
Meanwhile, there are some people, including UMass graduates. who are leaving Amherst due to various reasons and they are willing to sell many of their used goods for a lower price than new, instead of carrying them all the way or simply throwing them away. Our application aims to connect these two groups of people to each other in order to effectively help the UMass and Amherst community in satisfying some needs that might be specific to them.


## Why These Users Matter

This group is essential to UMassMarketPlace because they form the majority of residents of the town of Amherst and also in most cases seek to obtain goods with spending less money. 
We understand that managing finances can be challenging at the beginning and believe our application provides users with an opportunity to access goods and services with a more affordable price. Moreover, the application would reduce the waste and contribute towards the common goal of preserving the environment with reusing the reusable goods. 

## How we Adress These Needs

We created an application that allows users to easily browse items, add them to their cart, and view their selections with real-time updates. Each time the page is loaded or refreshed, the application checks the database to retain any previously added items in the cart. Users have the option to remove items from their cart as needed. When a transaction is completed, both parties receive each other's contact information to facilitate communication. The interface is designed to guide users through a seamless shopping process, addressing their core needs for a simple, intuitive, and efficient experience.
