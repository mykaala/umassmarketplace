# UI Diagrams

## Login Page

![Registration](https://github.com/mykaala/umassmarketplace/blob/ui-diagrams-md/loginpage.png?raw=true)
The login page will be the first screen that users will face when accessing our site. This page is designed so that only UMass Amherst students can access our services so we require a UMass email for authentication. Additionally, a "Forget your password" portion will be included to account for users who don't remember their login information.

**Use case**: A user who wants to access the website logs in by entering their UMass email and password, then clicks "Log In" to gain access to their account.

## Registration Page

The registration page will be presented to first time users who do not yet have an account. They will be prompted to enter their Umass email for authentication and be given the option to provide their password for the account.

**Use case**: A first-time user registers by entering their UMass email and choosing a password. After completing registration, they receive a confirmation email and verify their account.

## Product Listing Page

The product listing page will contain a list of products that the user can browse from. There will be a scroll wheel to allow the user to view all the products. Additionally, there will be a pagination included to allow the user to browse through different pages. A filter feature will also be included to help users narrow down their search.

**Use case**: A user browsing the product listing page scrolls through the available products. They use the filter feature to narrow down their options and navigate between pages using pagination to find the desired product.

## Product Detail Page

The product detail page gives comprehensive information about a specific product, allowing users to make purchasing decisions or view the seller's ratings and information. It also includes images, descriptions or other suggested products.

**Use case**: A student interested in a textbook can view detailed information, see images of the book, check the price, and contact the seller directly if they have questions or wish to negotiate the price.

## Post a Product Page

The Post a Product Page enables users to list items for sale on the University Marketplace Clone. The intuitive form guides users through the process of adding a new product, ensuring all necessary information is provided for potential buyers.

**Use case**: A student looking to sell their bicycle will navigate to the Post a Product Page, enters the title "Used Mountain Bike," provides a description, selects the "Outdoors" category, sets a price, specifies the pickup location, uploads photos of the bike, selects "Used" for condition, and clicks "Post" to list the bike for sale.
