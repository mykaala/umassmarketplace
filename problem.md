# Problem Statement

College students often face difficulties in finding an efficient and reliable platform to buy and sell used items within their campus community. 
Existing platforms are either too broad, making it hard to find campus-specific listings, or lack trust, leading to concerns over safety and fraud. 
As a result, students are left with limited options to trade textbooks, electronics, furniture, and other necessities, often resorting to less 
organized and inefficient methods such as bulletin boards or social media groups.
