# Problem Statement

College students often face difficulties in finding an efficient and reliable platform to buy and sell used items within their campus community. 
Existing platforms are either too broad, making it hard to find campus-specific listings, or lack trust, leading to concerns over safety and fraud. 
As a result, students are left with limited options to trade textbooks, electronics, furniture, and other necessities, often resorting to less 
organized and inefficient methods such as bulletin boards or social media groups.

## Objective

To develop a user-friendly online marketplace specifically designed for college students at UMass Amherst, allowing them to easily buy and sell items within the campus community. 
The platform will focus on ensuring trusted transactions between users integrating features such as verified student accounts, item categorization, and user feedback mechanisms to enhance the overall experience.


## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to develop an online marketplace which connects UMass students across campus. This web application would allow students to post items that they are selling and would allow other students to view those items that are to be sold and then buy them off the marketplace. The platform would also involve user authentication so users can create their own profile and we can verify that the buyers and sellers are students at the UMass campus.


## Why This Matters

This marketplace would help establish trust between buyers and sellers within the campus community. Right now it is hard for college students to find other college students to buy items from and sell items to. This would help college students engage with their peers and help them acquire and sell items that would be useful to them. The marketplace would centralize a platform where student-specific items can be sold to other students to campus, and it would an allow an easier access to items on sale that are acquirable on campus.
