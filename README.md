## Login Page
The login page will be the first screen that users will face when accessing our site. This page is designed so that only UMass Amherst students can access our services so we require a UMass email for authentication. Additionally, a "Forget your password" portion will be included to account for users who don't remember their login information.

## Registration Page
The registration page will be presented to first time users who do not yet have an account. They will be prompted to enter their Umass email for authentication and be given the option to provide their password for the account.
## Home Page

## Product Listing Page
The product listing page will contain a list of products that the user can browse from. There will be a scroll wheel to allow the user to view all the products. Additionally, there will be a pagination included to allow the user to browse through different pages. A filter feature will also be included to help users narrow down their search.
